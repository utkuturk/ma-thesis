These matherials relate to my Master Thesis **"Agreement Attraction in Turkish"** that were completed in June 2022.

They include 

- R code for analyzing, plotting, and Bayesian modeling behavioral experimental data
- JavaScript code and linguistic materials for the experiments conducted
- R code for fancy plots prepped for my defense

Our behavioral investigation included:

- How case syncretism affected agreement attraction
- How form advantage affected agreement attraction and whether participants used form heuristics
- Response bias calculation and how response bias and agreement attraction interact
- Whether Turkish agreement attraction effects are due to a possible honorific readings

It will include (in the near future)

- LaTeX code and PDF of my thesis
- Additional modelling of the previous experimental data
- MPT Modeling of the experimental data
